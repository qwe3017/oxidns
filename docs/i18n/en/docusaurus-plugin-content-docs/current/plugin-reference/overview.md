All OxiDNS capabilities ship as plugins, organized into four layers by responsibility:

- `server`: network ingress; listens for traffic and hands it to the policy entrypoint.
- `executor`: performs actions such as forwarding, caching, rewriting, observability, and system integrations.
- `matcher`: evaluates branch conditions for `sequence`.
- `provider`: supplies reusable domain / IP datasets consumed by matchers and executors.

Complex policies are usually built by composing several plugin types:

```text
server -> sequence
  -> matcher decides
  -> executor acts
  -> provider supplies datasets
  -> upstream or side effect
```

The full built-in plugin catalog is listed below. Click any plugin name to jump to its field reference.

## Server plugins

See [Server Plugins](server.mdx) for full field reference.

| Plugin | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`udp_server`](server/datagram-stream.mdx#udp_server) | Listens for DNS over UDP and forwards requests to `entry`. |
| [`tcp_server`](server/datagram-stream.mdx#tcp_server) | Listens for DNS over TCP. With `cert` and `key` configured it also serves as a DoT listener. |
| [`http_server`](server/encrypted-http.mdx#http_server) | Provides DNS over HTTPS (DoH) over HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and optional HTTP/3. |
| [`quic_server`](server/encrypted-http.mdx#quic_server) | Provides DNS over QUIC (DoQ). |

## Executor plugins

See [Executor Plugins](executor.mdx) for full field reference. Grouped as: policy orchestration → request handling → response rewriting → observability → side-effect integrations → maintenance.

### Policy orchestration

| Plugin | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`sequence`](executor/control-flow.mdx#sequence) | Orchestrates matchers and executors into a pipeline. The most common entry executor. |

### Response rewriting

| Plugin | Purpose |

| [`debug_print`](executor/observability.mdx#debug_print) | Prints request and response objects for debugging. |

### Side effects and system integration

| [`learn_domain`](executor/observability.mdx#learn_domain) | Learns pipeline request domains into `dynamic_domain_set` for dynamic allow or block lists. |
| [`script`](executor/integrations.mdx#script) | Runs an external command and injects a stable subset of `DnsContext` as arguments or environment variables. |
| [`ipset`](executor/integrations.mdx#ipset) | Writes response IPs into Linux `ipset` via the embedded netlink backend (no `ipset` binary required). |
| [`nftset`](executor/integrations.mdx#nftset) | Writes response IPs into nftables sets via the embedded netlink backend (no `nft` binary required). |
| [`ros_address_list`](executor/integrations.mdx#ros_address_list) | Projects response IPs into a RouterOS `address-list` consumed by firewall, mangle, or policy-routing rules. |
